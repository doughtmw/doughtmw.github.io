This paper investigates the accuracy and feasibilty of using a head-worn optical see-through display to project virtual models, which are derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, for guiding a surgeon during myocardial cell injections. See [link](https://doughtmw.github.io/files/Doughty-ISMRM-2019-3836.pdf) for more details.
