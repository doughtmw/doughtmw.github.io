This paper investigates the accuracy and feasibilty of using a head-worn optical see-through display to project virtual models, which are derived from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, for guiding a surgeon during myocardial cell injections.

The project incorporates a calibration procedure to account for the discrepancy between the coordinate system of a user's left and right eyes, and that of the head-mounted display tracking camera. A video showing the layout of the calibration procedure is shown on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTaQ_rj6PWI).
