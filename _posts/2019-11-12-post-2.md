I was surpised to find that there is no simple method in Unity to draw a rectangle (or bounding box) on a canvas. This project extends the Texture2D methods in Unity, providing a basic sample which demonstrates how to draw lines between specified 2D coordinates on a canvas and construct a bounding box, complete with label and confidence, around a cat! See the project on my personal [Github repo](https://github.com/doughtmw/BoundingBoxUtils-Unity) for more details.
