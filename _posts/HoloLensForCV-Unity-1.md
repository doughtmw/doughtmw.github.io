Sample project incorporating the HoloLens for CV sample from Microsoft into a C# project in Unity using IL2CPP Windows Runtime Support. Integrates OpenCV to enable real-time processing of sensor frames streamed from the Microsoft HoloLens device in a C# Unity environment. See the project on my personal [Github repo](https://github.com/doughtmw/HoloLensForCV-Unity) for more details.
