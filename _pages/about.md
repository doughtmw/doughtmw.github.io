I am a 3rd year PhD Student in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. I'm currently working under [Dr. Nilesh Ghugre](https://medbio.utoronto.ca/faculty/ghugre) as part of the [Cardiovascular MRI Research Group](https://sunnybrook.ca/research/content/?page=sri-groups-cmri) at Sunnybrook Research Institute.
