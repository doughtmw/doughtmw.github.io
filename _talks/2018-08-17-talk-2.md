I guided a group of [5th-grade research students](https://sunnybrook.ca/media/item.asp?c=1&i=1788&f=summer-student-research-day) through an augmented reality demonstration with image-derived virtual cardiac models. The students learned how to manipulate virtual objects with gestures and were fascinated with the ability to "punch" the virtual heart!
